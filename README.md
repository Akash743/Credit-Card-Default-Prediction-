# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction-
**The project is a classfication use case where the aim is to predict credit card default**. 

This notebook discusses about the whole data science project cycle involving EDA, visualizations, feature engineering, feature selection, model building.

Data source: Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud


We will be analyzing cardholdersâ€™ past data and history to predict default. If one is able to predict default even a month before its' occurrence, significant revenue savings can be made
    
    
**Sections**:


    - Data import
    - EDA: getting insights regarding class imbalance, outliers, distributions, etc. from the data using different plots
    - Data Pre-processing: Null value and outliers treatment 
    - Feature Engineering: Making new features
    - Train-test split
    - Data Scaling
    - Feature Selection
    - Model building: Logistic Regression and several others
    - Hyperparameter tuning
    - Comparing model performances using different metrics like COnfusion matrix, Accuracy, TPR, FPR, ROC-AUC 
    - Observations


Always welcome for feedbacks :)
